# PR Reviews

Now that you have made your PR it is time to wait for a review.

Keep in mind that for the most part, the nannou team and community members take
care of nannou in their personal time. As a result, it's difficult to say how
long it will take before your code is reviewed and accepted.

Here are some things you can do to help land your PR quickly:

- **Follow the [PR Checklist](./pr-checklist.md)**.
- **Request a review** from another community member. In particular, if your PR
  addresses an issue that someone else has commented on, they might be
  interested in taking a look. Reviews from other community members will make it
  much easier for the maintainers to trust and land your changes. Knowing this,
  if you see a PR from another community member, you might consider offering
  your own review!
