# Developer Reference

**TODO:** A guide to the architecture of Nannou's internals to help onboard new
developers. Describes the layout of modules, how to navigate the reference, the
scope of the main nannou crate i.e. the kinds of work that should go inside the
main repo and the kinds that might be better off in separate repos, etc.
