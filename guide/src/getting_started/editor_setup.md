# Editor Setup

While most popular development environments support Rust, support for certain
features like auto-completion and go-to-definition is better in some than
others.

### VS Code

For new Rust users we recommend using VS-Code as your editor and IDE for Nannou
development. Currently it seems to have the best support for the Rust language
including syntax highlighting, auto-complete, code formatting and more. It also
comes with an integrated unix terminal and file navigation system. Below are the
steps we recommend for getting started with Nannou development using VS-Code.

1. [Download VS-Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) for your OS.
2. [Install
   rust-analyzer](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=matklad.rust-analyzer) plugin for VS-Code.
3. Click on the 'view' menu and select 'integrated terminal'.
