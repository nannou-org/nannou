//! A small demonstration of how to use the `draw.scale(s)` and `draw.rotate(r)` transform methods
//! to transform the drawing context. This can be useful when applying transformations to whole
//! groups of drawings, rather than one at a time. Note that `scale` and `rotate` are only two of
//! many transform methods. See the link below to find a whole suite of interesting draw methods:
//!

    let draw = app.draw();
    draw.background().color(BLACK);
    let w = app.window_rect();

    // Slowly turn the whole drawing inside out.
    let draw = draw.scale((app.time() * 0.1).cos());

    // Draw a tunnel of rectangles.
    let max_side = w.right().max(w.top());
    let gap = 30.0;
    let len = (max_side / gap) as u32;
    for i in 1..=len {
        let f = i as f32 / len as f32;

        // Return a new rotated draw instance.
        // This will rotate both the rect and text around the origin.
        let rotate = (app.time() * 0.5).sin()
            * (app.time() * 0.25 + f * PI * 2.0).cos();
