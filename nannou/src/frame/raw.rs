/// Allows the user to draw a single **RawFrame** to the surface of a window.
///
/// The application's **view** function is called each time the application is ready to retrieve a
/// new image that will be displayed to a window. The **RawFrame** type can be thought of as the
/// canvas to which you draw this image.
///
/// ## Under the hood - WGPU
///
/// **RawFrame** provides access to the **wgpu::TextureViewHandle** associated with the swap
/// chain's current target texture for a single window.
///
/// In the case that your **view** function is shared between multiple windows, can determine which
/// window the **RawFrame** is associated with via the **RawFrame::window_id** method.
///
/// The user can draw to the swap chain texture by building a list of commands via a
/// `wgpu::CommandEncoder` and submitting them to the `wgpu::Queue` associated with the
/// `wgpu::Device` that was used to create the swap chain. It is important that the queue
/// matches the device. In an effort to reduce the chance for errors to occur, **RawFrame**
/// provides access to a `wgpu::CommandEncoder` whose commands are guaranteed to be submitted to
/// the correct `wgpu::Queue` at the end of the **view** function.
