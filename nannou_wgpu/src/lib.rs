//! Items related to wgpu and its integration in nannou!
//!
//! **WebGPU** is the portable graphics specification that nannou targets allowing us to write code
//! that is both fast and allows us to target a wide range of platforms. **wgpu** is the name of
//! the crate we use that implements this specification.
//!
//! This crate re-exports the entire `wgpu` crate along with all of its documentation while also
//! adding some additional items that makes `wgpu` easier to use alongside nannou.
//!
//! The `image` feature enables easier interoperation with the `image` crate, including functions
//! for uploading textures from image files.
//!
//! The `capturer` feature provides the `wgpu::TextureCapturer` API that aims to simplify the
//! process of downloading textures from the GPU and easily save them as image files. As an
//! example, this is particularly useful for recording the contents of a window or sketch.
//!
//! Note that when using `nannou_wgpu` via `nannou::wgpu`, both features are enabled by default.
//!
//! Useful links:
//!
//! - An awesome [guide for wgpu-rs](https://sotrh.github.io/learn-wgpu/#what-is-wgpu). Highly
//!   recommended reading if you would like to work more closely with the GPU in nannou!
//! - The [wgpu-rs repository](https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu-rs).
